<h2>Character Select Screen</h2>
The player can select their character of choice (which only differ by color, but it's a prototype for a character select.)

<h2>Board Generation</h2>
The board is created using a nested for-loop and instantiation of game objects. First, indestructible blocks are created, then destructible ones are placed around the board randomly.

<h2>Controls and Powerups</h2>
The player is controlled with WASD and Spacebar to drop bombs. As of now, powerups do not appear within the game, but once implented, they are functional.
